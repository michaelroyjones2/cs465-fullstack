Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
### The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because it makes it easier for it to store information. Not all info that will be collected is required at time of collection, it can be entered in later. To a sense all 3 used some form of HTML and CSS. Express was able to take advantage of shared elements and reuse a lot of content. This is where handlebars came into play. 

Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
### JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation. It is a file type that holds data in such a way that is easily readable by the Javascript langauge, hence the name. One specific instance that I recall refactoring code was making the different buttons. They all relatively had the same code, but we just needed to change labeling and maybe how they were called in a specific file, but that was it. It makes your job as a developer much easier when you are able to reuse and refactor code.

Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
### For this project, our testing methods were primarily focused around either the terminal log messages (ex "user not found") or the error code (404,200). The status codes would let us know if the test was successful or not. Towards the end when we were trying to login with the user's credentials and it connected, we could check in the developer tools of the browser for the token, or within the terminal for the 200 code to show that it connected. The API Methods themselves being GET, PUT, POST, DELETE. Any time you add security to anything it is going to make it more difficult. For example, you could make a Get call but if you dont have logon credentials, then you won't be able to get any results from the query.

Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
###This course has really helped me because it has given me a really good foundation to build upon for Full Stack development. I'm not sure if I want to be a full stack developer but I know that it is a great toolset to have; especially in today's growing SaaS economy.
